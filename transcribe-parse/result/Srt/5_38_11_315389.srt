1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,560
But you also experiment a little bit with actual DMT as well. I absolutely. 

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,460
Can you describe. 

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,120
That experience? 

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:15,130
I listen it's really. 

5
00:00:15,70 --> 00:00:15,400
Crazy. 

6
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,460
This is my partner. This. 

7
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,780
Is my partner I'm doing the GM. 

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:28,800
And my part is right here and then I used. 

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,700
To like the sun opens up. And I feel like the fucking boom, the sun over and the air. 

10
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,550
Cost. Do you see that to see what I. 

11
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:58,170
Hear it? I think they're playing tricks. I think because my crew likes to prank me all the time is I think they're pranking mess. I know you. 

12
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,40
See this shit. 

13
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,370
Don'T. 

14
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,900
You either, Mike? I don't. 

15
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,460
See how long did that last. 

16
00:01:03,30 --> 00:01:04,30
That'S. 

17
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:10,420
For a minute, what literally one minute? Not like no for a minute sometime for. 

18
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,980
20 minutes. Also. 

19
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:21,160
Delis like that, though, are also if you take one too many mushrooms. The sun opens up. I don't think like that. Okay. 

20
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,460
We also do the total we experience with the time. 

21
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:25,760
Yeah. 

22
00:01:26,30 --> 00:01:27,170
So what did. 

23
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:32,30
You smoke you smoke the venom on the back of a toad. Or how does it work? But it's not like the. 

24
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,100
Rest of we smoking your active. You can. 

25
00:01:34,70 --> 00:01:34,550
Be active. 

26
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,840
As soon as you take the hit. Boom, your soul goes here and your body goes here. Oh. 

27
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,60
No here in the United States for that. As well, or is that a Mexico I've done in. 

28
00:01:45,30 --> 00:01:46,80
Mexico? I. 

29
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,240
Think Chihuahua is one of the precincts and. 

30
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:48,990
The Mexico. 

31
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:56,580
Great crazy and that's like that's the highest right, can you go above the toad? They say no, but the. 

32
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,10
Lizard tail is very close. The snake venom is very close to white. Corp is very close. 

33
00:02:02,10 --> 00:02:05,790
How did you figure this out that's the history that is the first time is a snake. 

34
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,200
Let'S. 

35
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,390
Smoke, it no history. 

36
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:23,380
Told us what happened. This is what happened they saw an animal attacks. I forgot what animal was. But it was an animal player. Attack it and they started acting weird and trembling and. 

37
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,520
Without and. 

38
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,240
They thought it was pointed then 20 minutes. He came back up and just. 

39
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:28,780
Took off. 

40
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:36,670
And so the Native American food at. And they sort of didn't die that you won't back up. And I guess that's how to experience. 

41
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:41,290
That actually makes sense that doesn't make a lot actually makes sense. But what is that feeling like, for you. 

42
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,220
To leave your body. 

43
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,830
Like, do you actually feel like you left your body? 

44
00:02:45,220 --> 00:03:15,360
It's the most scariest experience for everything go through in their lives. To not that you're dead. Hey, man, I don't want to do that. I do want to do that. Listen in life. Do you just want to be you? Right now, do you want to be this way to the day you die? No, you think working on it? No, but do you want to be like this? To the day you die the same mentality. The same way you think about life the same way you think about humanity right now, you want to stop right here I want to move forward, but that's what the to does? It. 

45
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:31,170
Actually makes you move sideways it's not forward. I say this all the time to people I say what if someone told you that there was a way to see life in a completely different way, where up wasn't up and right wasn't right. And everything was different you wouldn't want to at least experience that 1-2-1 before you pass. 

46
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:43,210
Go deeper. That experience being God for a few minutes that's what it does introduce you to God. What are you thinking on one basis that's. 

47
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:43,930
What people say? 

48
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:44,500
Georgie. 

49
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:55,960
Listen I'm not encouraging I'm glad you as a person in my standing, I have to actually it didn't go so well done in 16 times the toad. What do you mean? Will you see God. 

50
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,100
Like. 

51
00:03:57,70 --> 00:03:58,570
You see him or you're equal to him. 

52
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,100
Okay. 

53
00:04:02,40 --> 00:04:06,20
So you're equal to got. 

54
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,370
It. I don't think. 

55
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:11,660
George is gonna like that he's a very he's no, very big Christian man no, no. 

56
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,340
This is bigger than religion. 

57
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:13,670
Right? 

58
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,550
And. 

59
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,590
Also, I don't this. 

60
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:30,620
Is Dian. This is time. This is letting this stuff. You see your ancestors want to be some answers you want to meet people who died. Recently you love handle it. The total it takes you way back, buddy. This. 

61
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:38,690
Is scary I'm not sure I want that smoke. I don't know if I can handle it. Is there any God forbid? If you do. 

62
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,460
Like a tiny bit too much die. 

63
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,550
You can't die from it, I okay, so it's just a for sure experience. 

64
00:04:44,0 --> 00:04:50,330
And if you look at medically, it took people off of drugs to stop people from being Hispanic. 

65
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:51,500
Depressed.
